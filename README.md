# OperatingSystem_ForkThreadsProjects_LINUX

Fork - Threads - LINUX

This repository contains 5 small projects on understanding how fork and threads work.
Code written by Velasco Paola student at University of West Attica 2020-21, for the subject "Operating Systems II"

## 01. [Understanding how fork works](https://github.com/PaolaVlsc/OperatingSystem_ForkThreadsProjects_LINUX/tree/main/01_Understanding%20how%20fork%20works)

A simple explanation on the connection between parents and children

## 02. [Process Hierarchy and Inter-Process Communication](https://github.com/PaolaVlsc/OperatingSystem_ForkThreadsProjects_LINUX/tree/main/02_Process%20Hierarchy%20and%20Inter-Process%20Communication)

A simple C program that demonstrates process creation using `fork()` and inter-process communication through pipes in a Unix-like environment.

## 03. [Multi-Threaded Sum of Squares Calculator](https://github.com/PaolaVlsc/OperatingSystem_ForkThreadsProjects_LINUX/tree/main/03_Multi-Threaded%20Sum%20of%20Squares%20Calculator)

This C program demonstrates multi-threading using the Pthreads library in a Unix-like environment. It calculates the sum of squares of numbers in an array using multiple threads. This example showcases the power of parallel computing in a simple application.

## 04. [Multi-Threaded String Sequencer](https://github.com/PaolaVlsc/OperatingSystem_ForkThreadsProjects_LINUX/tree/main/04_Multi-Threaded%20String%20Sequencer)

This C program illustrates the use of threads and semaphores to control the concurrent printing of strings from three different threads. It coordinates the output of `<one>`, `<two>`, and `<three>` strings to demonstrate how semaphores can synchronize thread execution in a Unix-like environment.

## 05. [Multi-Threaded Max Value Finder](https://github.com/PaolaVlsc/OperatingSystem_ForkThreadsProjects_LINUX/tree/main/05_Multi-Threaded%20Max%20Value%20Finder)

This C program showcases multi-threading using pthreads and demonstrates how to find the maximum value within a matrix. It synchronizes threads, calculates local maximum values, and then determines the global maximum.
